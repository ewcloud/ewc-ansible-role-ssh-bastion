# SSH Bastion Ansible Role

This repository contains a configuration template 
(i.e. an [Ansible Role](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html)) 
to customize your environment in the
[European Weather Cloud (EWC)](https://europeanweather.cloud/).
The template is designed to:
* Configure a pre-existing virtual machine running RockyLinux version 8.10 or 9.5,
with public IP address, and a minimum recommended 4GB of RAM, as entrypoint for
users who wish to reach private EWC networks, from the public internet, via SSH.

## Usage

The step-by-step described below assume your local file system follows the 
example structure below, with `ewc-ansible-role-ssh-bastion` being a clone of this
repository:
```
.
├── roles
│   └── ewc-ansible-role-ssh-bastion
├── inventory.yml
└── playbook.yml
```

### 1. Specify the target host and SSH credentials
Create an inventory file to specify address/credentials that Ansible should use
to reach the virtual machine you wish to configure:
```yaml
# inventory.yml
---
ewcloud:
  hosts:
    ssh_bastion:
      ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python3
      ansible_host: <add the IPV4 address of the target host>
      ansible_ssh_private_key_file: <add the path to local SSH RSA private key file>
      ansible_user: <add the username which owns the SSH RSA private key >
```
### 2. Customize the template

Edit input values for the template [variables](./vars/main.yml) as needed (see
[Inputs](#inputs) section for details).
Then, proceed to create an Ansible Playbook file to load your customizations: 

```yaml
# playbook.yml
---
- name: Setup SSH daemon on RockyLinux
  hosts: ssh_bastion
  become: true
  become_user: root
  become_method: ansible.builtin.sudo

  roles:
    - ewc-ansible-role-ssh-bastion
```

### 3. Apply the template


You can apply changes on the target host by running:
```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml playbook.yml
```

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| whitelist_ip_ranges | IPv4 ranges (in CIDR format) to be whitelisted in Fail2ban configuration. When in doubt, do not set. Example: `['10.0.0.0/24']` | `list(string)` | n/a | no |
